This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Copy file `env` into `.env`
2. Fill the variable in `.env` by following the guide that has been included in the file
3. Duplicate [template sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HiV217nBjcSdOqEW6YqbVF5RswbX258KCXw0SiXQxd8/edit?usp=sharing) and use it for your project. Your new template sheet's id should be added to SPREADSHEET_ID in `.env`
4. You are ready to go, run the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```
